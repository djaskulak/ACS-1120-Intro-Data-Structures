Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress
(Kill them in that)

I'm beautiful
I know it's so
I'm beautiful [x2]
See you in that

Powder, set yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress [x2]

Hey, Nayima
'Sup Sabrina
Hey, Naomi
Love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doing too much with your dude in the sheets
Now you soft like 300 count
Little rubber band tuckin' 300 thou'
Throw it on the floor, make 300 bounce
Can you make a 16 come out 300 mouths?
Cause I might have the check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny I am coming for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails

As usual
I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticle
And boo, you should know
I'm so doable
It's quite provable
That we beautiful

[Hook]

And it ain't about being good looking
It's your brains, how they working
Get that good sookie-sookie
I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-looking
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playing hookie
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you can call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty posting all them selfies
Help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head?
Cause maybe we can intersect
Cos sexually you interest
Boy, visually you is a yes
(No respect!)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you
Too focused on the booty
You bastard bachelors
Is really acting like you're Clooney
Ya'll truly won't be players
Til you learn to see the beauty
(Male groupies!)
Can't say I blame you if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
Cause even if you think you knew me
A woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me
With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf what is good

Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom

You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up
But you call me wifey

So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips right here
Got me searching for insight
Insight? Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass

And his every interval fast -
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash
When you enter, enter me
Gentle then, yeah, ease up
I'm day dreaming

Now, whoa, I never daydream
But you jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf what is good
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that

But I wonder why I still feel so alone
Blow Weed Coke pop X
Speeding up the heartbeat
Banging in my chest

When you put it on me
You relieve my stress
You got me so high
Takin' deep, deep breaths

You get me so high
You get me so high
I know you ain't a drug
But you get me so high

You get me so high
You get me so high
You get me so high
You get me so high, high

You got me so turnt up
This dude gotta be so high
Weed always on my mind
No, he always on my mind

Doja..

You ain't gotta say a word
Just spark that let's get burnt

Then we'll roll up
A hunnit fuckin' blunts
All up in my mouth
Now I'm all up in yo...

This nigga got pounds of it
All up in his trunk
Now we both look Asian
He waving and I'm drunk

I got dank shit in my cup
You know what Imma do you
I can get real used to you
Blow Weed X and we sipping on that juice (juice)
That's just what we choose to do
Man, this shit these drugs would do to you
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh

They say I bang
They never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk
Walk but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door
Avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak
Bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel
Rock the lease

How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany – free)
All these bars, no police

He calls me copper tone
Smoking ultraviolet
We turn off the phone
I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear
Mr. Copperfield
When we ride he bust them tricks
I lean and pop a wheel
Watching brandy sipping brandy
Panties on the marble floor
Guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tap me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Mmm, that's nasty but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xanies for me quick

Pop a couple xanies for me quick
Pop a couple xanies for me bitch

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany – free)
All these bars, no police

Yellow bars, get it in
Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitties hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put easy a crazy pass so

Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you

Now pop this with me

I act like I don't want you
Like it's whatever
Shit it ain't a thing
When really I wanna flaunt you
You really need a queen
So be a, be a king

Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea

I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're getting high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

And it's such a typical thing
Running over a billion men.
Running through a difficult place
You don't need no blood on your hands, no

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

I can be your sugar when you're fiending for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

And it's such a typical thing
Running over a billion men.
Running through a difficult place
You don't need no blood on your hands, no

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

Sugar-coated lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

Sugar-coated lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before

Yah, throw hands in the air
Swear I can't bring that ass anywhere
You don't wanna fling, bring that ass over here
Boy, feelin' like a contest, how you wanna stare
Your attention span prolly long as your hair, too
If you're true, why you gotta dare, boo?
Some win and some gotta lose
You really need love, two L's, no cool
It is not me, nor them, just you
Acting like a fiend and the perp gon' shoot
Act seventeen when you're thirty-two
Pussy too clean and it purty too
So I can't intervene on your escapades
'Cause I ain't really tryna be the next to pay
And be the next to say, "I got an ex today"
I can see it in your eyes when you flex your games and shit (Yeah)

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
Take it off, follow me now
Let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if
That's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now
Let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if
That's not how it really is

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player I don't think I'ma play with you, uh huh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?

You say you don't want a girlfriend
But when we are in person
You always act so different
You make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up
Say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient
How am I supposed to take it?

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

We two could chill just sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we need it more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right
Pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines
Being shy just ain't my style, now

You say you don't want a girlfriend
But when we are in person
You always act so different
You make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up
Say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient
How am I supposed to take it?

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

If you wanna be the one, don't act that way
And waste my day, I'm not that way

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Spend your life with me?
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Shoulda never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like bein' trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

Hard for me to let you go (Let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (Hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (Wouldn't fold, wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightnin'

(And I)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(And I)
Needed a fix of you, not just one kiss from you
I needed more

Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh (My baby, my baby)

But you fuckin' me up on this FaceTime
Faded, pourin' all over you
Know exactly what I wanna do
So, baby, can you get it from the back?
Got me purrin' like I'm Doja Cat
Keep me in your bag
'Cause you wanna hear me say I'm comin' back
But this time, I want support, just make it last
Woah-oh (Ah)

It's hard for me to let you go (Let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (Wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightnin'

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause

We just love to dream
In my fantasy when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost

I don't want to close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall (Fall), after they did it all (All)
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep (Sleep) but in reality ('Ty)
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's gettin' under my skin, baby
I wouldn't wonder why

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause

We just love to dream
In my fantasy when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby (Na-na-na-na-na), it's just me (Na-na-na-na-na)
I don't believe (Na-na-na-na-na) what I just lost (Na-na-na-na-na)
(I say, I say, I say) (Na-na-na-na-na)

And I say, "Ooh, stop it", ayy
I look a little like Nashe, ayy
You look a little exhausted, ayy (Yah)
We should say no to the party, ayy (Huh)
Take me home in the Bugatti, ayy (Yahh)
Hope you like a little tear, put it on his tea
That way you have a matcha, ayy
Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah (My bonnet)
Take a minute for the finer things (Yah)
I don't even wanna sleep
You doin' some weed, blow it in my China bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Pickin' up the sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the mornin' signs
Show up, hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him (Yo)
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades (Prada shades)
Tits on him and I ride away (Ride away)
(How much do you want it?) Twice a day
(Four times) On the holidays (Yuh)
Can you come through and your dreams come true
And trust me, you won't ever fall asleep

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms (And I hope you)
I got everything, everything but real love (And I hope you)
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out (And I hope you)
Or you could leave me there, 'cause (Or leave me there)

We just love to dream (And I hope you)
In my fantasy (And I hope you) when you woke up, oh (And I hope you)

Said, you right, I

'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you'd never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairy tales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Oh, you could take it out on me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to be

Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy
When you're on top of me
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate
'Cause you choose loyalty
I know your history
Met him before your peak
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in then you'll belong to me

I got a man but I want you
I got a man but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you

And you're right
You right, I
Got my guy
But I, I
Can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I
Got my guy
But I, I

When they had no faith at all (Faith at all)
One minute they bum me, then go pray to God (Pray to God)
But the grindin' go completely unrelatable
Like imagine, imagine
Thick as fuck but all I eat is salad
Saucin' with my thousands on an island
Got imagination 'cause I'm childish

Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
I pull up just like ooh, you a baddie
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion

Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and leave (Alone)
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die (Alone)
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high (Alone)
You ain't even there for me
Now you scared to be (Alone)

Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're in after I thought I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' me reasons to fly
Pack all my shit and be wise
Jump in the ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, least we try

Baby, when you fought at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)

I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (Yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass mouthy
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Finger middle to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed the whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than needs control, cherish it

Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do it, you the best in me (Alone)
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die (Alone)
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high (Alone)
You ain't even there for me
Now you scared to be (Alone)

(Alone)
Now you scared to be (Alone)
We hug and yes, we make love

Somethin' we just gotta get into

Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga

You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
