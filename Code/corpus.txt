Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress
(Kill them in that)

I'm beautiful
I know it's so
I'm beautiful [x2]
See you in that

Powder, set yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress [x2]

Hey, Nayima
'Sup Sabrina
Hey, Naomi
Love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doing too much with your dude in the sheets
Now you soft like 300 count
Little rubber band tuckin' 300 thou'
Throw it on the floor, make 300 bounce
Can you make a 16 come out 300 mouths?
Cause I might have the check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny I am coming for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails

As usual
I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticle
And boo, you should know
I'm so doable
It's quite provable
That we beautiful

[Hook]

And it ain't about being good looking
It's your brains, how they working
Get that good sookie-sookie
I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-looking
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playing hookie
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you can call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty posting all them selfies
Help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head?
Cause maybe we can intersect
Cos sexually you interest
Boy, visually you is a yes
(No respect!)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you
Too focused on the booty
You bastard bachelors
Is really acting like you're Clooney
Ya'll truly won't be players
Til you learn to see the beauty
(Male groupies!)
Can't say I blame you if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
Cause even if you think you knew me
A woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me
With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf what is good

Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom

You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up
But you call me wifey

So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips right here
Got me searching for insight
Insight? Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass

And his every interval fast -
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash
When you enter, enter me
Gentle then, yeah, ease up
I'm day dreaming

Now, whoa, I never daydream
But you jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf what is good
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that

But I wonder why I still feel so alone
Blow Weed Coke pop X
Speeding up the heartbeat
Banging in my chest

When you put it on me
You relieve my stress
You got me so high
Takin' deep, deep breaths

You get me so high
You get me so high
I know you ain't a drug
But you get me so high

You get me so high
You get me so high
You get me so high
You get me so high, high

You got me so turnt up
This dude gotta be so high
Weed always on my mind
No, he always on my mind

Doja..

You ain't gotta say a word
Just spark that let's get burnt

Then we'll roll up
A hunnit fuckin' blunts
All up in my mouth
Now I'm all up in yo...

This nigga got pounds of it
All up in his trunk
Now we both look Asian
He waving and I'm drunk

I got dank shit in my cup
You know what Imma do you
I can get real used to you
Blow Weed X and we sipping on that juice (juice)
That's just what we choose to do
Man, this shit these drugs would do to you
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh

They say I bang
They never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk
Walk but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door
Avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak
Bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel
Rock the lease

How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany – free)
All these bars, no police

He calls me copper tone
Smoking ultraviolet
We turn off the phone
I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear
Mr. Copperfield
When we ride he bust them tricks
I lean and pop a wheel
Watching brandy sipping brandy
Panties on the marble floor
Guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tap me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Mmm, that's nasty but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xanies for me quick

Pop a couple xanies for me quick
Pop a couple xanies for me bitch

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany – free)
All these bars, no police

Yellow bars, get it in
Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitties hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put easy a crazy pass so

Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you

Now pop this with me

I act like I don't want you
Like it's whatever
Shit it ain't a thing
When really I wanna flaunt you
You really need a queen
So be a, be a king

Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea
Anything you know, you might have every idea

I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're getting high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

And it's such a typical thing
Running over a billion men.
Running through a difficult place
You don't need no blood on your hands, no

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

I can be your sugar when you're fiending for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

And it's such a typical thing
Running over a billion men.
Running through a difficult place
You don't need no blood on your hands, no

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

Sugar-coated lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

Sugar-coated lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before

Yah, throw hands in the air
Swear I can't bring that ass anywhere
You don't wanna fling, bring that ass over here
Boy, feelin' like a contest, how you wanna stare
Your attention span prolly long as your hair, too
If you're true, why you gotta dare, boo?
Some win and some gotta lose
You really need love, two L's, no cool
It is not me, nor them, just you
Acting like a fiend and the perp gon' shoot
Act seventeen when you're thirty-two
Pussy too clean and it purty too
So I can't intervene on your escapades
'Cause I ain't really tryna be the next to pay
And be the next to say, "I got an ex today"
I can see it in your eyes when you flex your games and shit (Yeah)

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
Take it off, follow me now
Let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if
That's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now
Let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if
That's not how it really is

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player I don't think I'ma play with you, uh huh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?

You say you don't want a girlfriend
But when we are in person
You always act so different
You make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up
Say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient
How am I supposed to take it?

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

We two could chill just sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we need it more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right
Pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines
Being shy just ain't my style, now

You say you don't want a girlfriend
But when we are in person
You always act so different
You make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up
Say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient
How am I supposed to take it?

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

If you wanna be the one, don't act that way
And waste my day, I'm not that way

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Spend your life with me?
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Shoulda never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like bein' trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

Hard for me to let you go (Let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (Hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (Wouldn't fold, wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightnin'

(And I)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(And I)
Needed a fix of you, not just one kiss from you
I needed more

Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)

But you fuckin' me up on this FaceTime
Faded, pourin' all over you

So, baby, can you get it from the back?
Got me purrin' like I'm Doja Cat
Keep me in your bag
'Cause you wanna hear me say I'm comin' back
But this time, I want support, just make it last
Woah-oh (Ah)

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause

We just love to dream
In my fantasy when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost

I don't want to close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall (Fall), after they did it all (All)
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep (Sleep) but in reality ('Ty)
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's gettin' under my skin, baby
I wouldn't wonder why

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause

We just love to dream

I don't believe (Na-na-na-na-na) what I just lost (Na-na-na-na-na)
(I say, I say, I say) (Na-na-na-na-na)

And I say, "Ooh, stop it", ayy
I look a little like Nashe, ayy
You look a little exhausted, ayy (Yah)
We should say no to the party, ayy (Huh)
Take me home in the Bugatti, ayy (Yahh)
Hope you like a little tear, put it on his tea
That way you have a matcha, ayy
Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah (My bonnet)
Take a minute for the finer things (Yah)
I don't even wanna sleep
You doin' some weed, blow it in my China bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Pickin' up the sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the mornin' signs
Show up, hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him (Yo)
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades (Prada shades)
Tits on him and I ride away (Ride away)
(How much do you want it?) Twice a day
(Four times) On the holidays (Yuh)
Can you come through and your dreams come true
And trust me, you won't ever fall asleep

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms (And I hope you)
I got everything, everything but real love (And I hope you)
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out (And I hope you)
Or you could leave me there, 'cause (Or leave me there)

We just love to dream (And I hope you)

You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairy tales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep

Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy
When you're on top of me
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate
'Cause you choose loyalty
I know your history
Met him before your peak
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in then you'll belong to me

I got a man but I want you
I got a man but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you

And you're right
You right, I

One minute they bum me, then go pray to God (Pray to God)
But the grindin' go completely unrelatable
Like imagine, imagine
Thick as fuck but all I eat is salad
Saucin' with my thousands on an island
Got imagination 'cause I'm childish

Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
I pull up just like ooh, you a baddie

Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and leave (Alone)
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die (Alone)
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high (Alone)
You ain't even there for me
Now you scared to be (Alone)

Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're in after I thought I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' me reasons to fly
Pack all my shit and be wise
Jump in the ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, least we try

Baby, when you fought at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)

I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (Yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass mouthy
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Finger middle to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed the whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than needs control, cherish it

Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do it, you the best in me (Alone)
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die (Alone)
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high (Alone)
You ain't even there for me
Now you scared to be (Alone)

(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)

I know you're going home to your lady, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Baby got mystery and I got history
Don't get too into me, you could get in too deep
Head past the settle down, knock 'til you're out of town
I just wan' f- right now, scared it might get around
I like what I like, you like what you do
You see my eyes, boy I just can't keep 'em off you
Turnin' me on, I-I just can't see through you
God bless your girl 'cause this feeling, it is voodoo

I know you're going home to your lady, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Mm, tonight
Mm-mm, tonight
Oh, mm, tonight (Haha, yo)
Oh, ooh-mm, tonight

Ayo, had a dream about you knockin' on my door
And then we end up kickin' it with you up in my arms
Every time she ringin', you not answering the phone
Said you'd be a minute and still ain't made it home, uh
Let's get it on tonight
Blame it on the liquor, we'on't know what's wrong from right
Meltin' on me, ice cream, baby, slip and slide
Are you changin' your clothes or are you changin' your mind?
'Cause we both know there's only one place you'll be goin'
Baby, down at the garden, have you eatin' them greens
Got you speakin' in tongues, mi amor, E-V-E
Long as you ready to drive, limousine, Doja Cat

I know you're going home to your lady, tonight (Yeah)
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Oh, where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry?
(Why won't you cry?)
This is what's telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

Boy, I'm lookin' at you, don't walk away
Comin' home at like two, then four, then eight
Boy, you lookin' like you don't know my name
Every day you wanna butter me up
Then, you're pushin' me out the way
Yeah, now you wanna be a bad boy, papa
Y'ain't a man, you're just a handsome knock-off
I saw you sneakin', tryna plant one on her
Oh, you mad all the sudden?
'Cause your man got my number (Yeah)
I wish you saw what I saw in you
Never open that door to you and give it all to you
How the fuck I wasn't on in you?
And it's a round of applause, but I'm warnin' you, boo

Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry?
(Why won't you cry?)
This is what's telling me, you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

Maybe I'm a toy 'til you wind me
I be on a run 'til you find me
Bad ting, I don't want a bad mind, me
Can't wait 'til you realize, finally
Big mouth but, the steam on tiny
I been seein' everythin' unwindin'
And I bought all of your chains in a fistful
Rollie dead on your wrist, untimely
Baby, need somebody to trust in me
Need somebody to love on me, baby, baby, oh
Low key, I love it when you talk to me
But I don't wanna be your one-night thing
Help me, can we? Oh

Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry?
(Why won't you cry?)
This is what's telling me, you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down
Baby, when I go wyl' like that

And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby

Lemme hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
Said, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh-why, oh-why-oh?"

Hit me when you're frustrated
You ain't picky and get ignorant 'round all my ladies
I could come fix you, but you broke-headed
You want Whitney, you want Britney, Jennifer and Halle
(Baby)
They ain't been cold like me
Put them bitches in my old winter coat
That is so last week
Them other niggas, they been waitin' for it
They gon' hold my seat
Kryptonite when I throwin' ass, 'cause I know your weakness
I can't forget how it used to be
In your thoughts, livin' good with me
And it feel so right, when I make you scream, "please"

Baby, when I go wyl' like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that

(The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are full of chicks
And they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're)

Hm, mm, mm
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass in the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I have flashed from the genesis
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends are pretend
Wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna send shit
Ends with a sniff, or a huff, or injection
I can't handle rejection
Can't stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I'm weak?
So I fall behind every week?
I'm too shy when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the street to the gutters to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep, I say "Mother never weep"
My brother finds blood, I say "Shut up 'fore she sees"
Another motherfucking trap
W-wonder when she weeps, w-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spit natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense"
You're testing the masters, so guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, can they get big checks from the sets?
Next, from the dancers
Text from the models, this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles

I swear on my life I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

Better luck next time
Better-better-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Next time)
Better-better-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Bet-bet, bet-bet
Bet-bet, bet-bet
Yeah, big ole ass, my jeans ain't got no room

Boom, boom, boom, boom

Gotta put it down might sit on the cash
Got a lil brown, one lick on the tan
Lil drip on the neck, six figure on the hand

When I lift both doors and I hit on the gas
Then zoom zoom
Get out the fast lane
Boom boom
That's what my ass say
Bow bow
Lovin my back weight
Uh uh
Give her the ashtray
She don't want smoke, bitch, whip out the band aids
Don't get cut, catch a bitch on a bad day

Animal crackers goin in y'all soup

Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high-heeled shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottom, made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Back-bend till I touch my toes, and
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew 'cause they hope I choke

Don't need a report, don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones

I am advanced so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel their plans
Said, boo, don't be mad 'cause you had a chance

Drop
Said, I took it and I ran for it
I run it and I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, finna put a tan on it
Said, I took it and I ran for it

Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, finna put a tan on it like

You make me so dizzy
Spinning feelings inside
Shining heart is spinning for you
When I see you you know I get dizzy

Damn, you be making me hot though
Spin this little nigga tryna touch legato
Tryna make cheese like Louise is natural
Nigga making my ass go into my cargo
Your lame main chick is a thot tho
I'm kinda Busch or I'm kinda Picasso
Picking up the fruit bitch gimme the box yo
I'm a smooth little kitty if you really did not know
And I'm under the influence
Shaking your business
Swaying my hips to this
Ya, I'm getting it in (it in)
Breaking their neck like they go to gym (the gym)
It's you that I'm going but I really ain't into him
What the fuck is your Instagram?
I don't fuck with your image ,man
Baby Boy is you listening? (What?)
And it feels alright
Don't leave me off your side
Can't even question why
Something I just won't fight
So lose yourself in the groove~
Yeah, I'll make your wishes come true~
When we move, I don't really know how you make me do what I do
One shot and I'm so blue
Baby I'm stuck to you
Yeah, said I'm not kissing nobody, boy, I got my lipgloss on
Shut up (Hush), why you talkin' when you know that this my song?
This ain't really the night to blow me up, I ditched my phone
Five shots, ready to party, throwin' it back, it's principle
Throwin' it back like fishing pole, throwin' it back like fishing pole
All of your junk like physical
That's just how we do it, not a rhyme or a reason
We signing broads in the front while you look off in the bleachers
We pullin' up the way we do to keep the audience tweetin'
The farther we goin' up, it's like the harder they reachin'
If you see my titties, I tell 'em record it and keep it
A couple twins sittin' pretty, no Victoria Secret (Yeah, c'mon)
Heal my heart
Take my temperature, it feels so hot
Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor

Yah, yah
It's the uniform, fantasy dick - unicorn
Feeling me, feeling you, head feeling warm
Head break, headaches in the Bentley
Crack kills, take a Advil when the bed shake
Steady on it, ready with it, that's a heavy dosage
Check up on it, baby watch it while he check up on it
Feeling hot, cold sweats got the fever now
Need a shot, need the cock, need to see the Doc

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

I got a PHD in the D
Put the P in the V
DC wanna see
Open up wide, say 'aah' when I ride
Take off in the day, house calls in the night
Beat it 'till the kitty sees stars in the night
Put the pussy in the ER in the night
Take one of these, twice, morning and night
And if I'm still walking you ain't tore it up right

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

Heal my heart
Take my temperature, it feels so hot
Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor
Heal my heart
Take my temperature, it feels so hot
Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor

Spice up your life, come get a freak (do do do do do do do)

Tie him down to my queen bed
Tease him just enough to hate me (hate me)
Tied it tight enough, he can’t break free (break free)

I could fuck him in the range
I could fuck him everyday
I'ma fuck him 'til he sing
Milkshake bring the boys to the yard

I'll never let you leave daddy
Cause there's some things you need to see daddy
So everybody give it up for my baby
Cause we gon' live it up til our days is gone
Give it up for my baby, come on, come on

And we might touch the surface of space
Cause love is kind to those who grow
Just tell'em you don't know who I be
Yeah, I got a couple tricks up my sleeve
So roll'em up, all them haters are bored of us
I'm waiting for ya, I can't afford the love
Can't you see, you ain't live in a fantasy world, yeah
Can't ya keep up?
Sippin margarita
Call me Senorita
Dancing in my Lita's
Looking like Vita
Coco, I'm sweeter
You can't really be her
Follow me and I'll lead ya

Who you better than?
We go farther than never than
Taking off and I never land
Yellow bitches and yellow sand
Remy, weed and stiletto hands
Pop the pussy like metal cans
Fur coat and I'm shedding man
Ha, steez
Cause I see the light
Give you what you need tonight
We don't [?] we behind
Simple plans, we just lead behind
Don't make me count to 6, give you kittens time outs and shit
Key you whippin then mount your bitch
Run for it, now my mouth is [?]
Damnit Doja, that hurts, no fair
See my team, we just circle squares
Bad bitches with purple hair with attitudes that no man can bare
Uh oh, look at what the cat dragged in
Keep the rats out my cat mansion
Fuck all your opinions, I don't give them atten-ti-on
[?] sugar fish and that sushi roll
Cool ya chick, keep ya uzi home
Uzi home
Double cup, po' it in
Sweat it out and then sew it in
Beamer benz and polish friends
Yoo, but mirror who is the coldest bitch?
Mirror who be the coldest bitch?
Mirror who is the coldest bitch?
Mirror who be the coldest bitch?
How the fuck you live so golden?
How you make your mouth and your wrist all frozen
No handlebars but my hips so Hogan
Pockets make the thou when I'm feeling so bloated
Click, bang, pow, now your speakers are loaded
New JC's, I can't wait to put my toes in
Posin' and all them little niggas start jonesin'
We might have something in common cause I admit I'm focused
I've been riding through The Hills like Heidi
Twerkin' on his suit like Miley
He chasin' like Coyote, Wile E
So I ain't surprised if his bitch tryna bite me
(It's so thick, you know this)

I'm high as fuck
Light that dutch
Mocking when I'm walking
Ya, they bite that much
And they stalking my circumference, make your pipe stand up
Like a mic I adjust it I don't hide that stuff
Niggas in the kitchen with that white, doing bumps
I do not need that in my life I do not light that stuff
(oh shit!)
So I pick up where I left of yes I still go hard
This the payback to them bitches who can't write there own bars
Imma go far, might be on mars
Preference is on Pluto where I sight see all the stars
I'm high lit smoking violet
My wallets on a diet
Serve em' [?] leather sinch body I'm a goddess
Walking through the crowds
Like I am Isis
I should do it now I should try this
I kind of recognize this
Holy Shit niggas in the back...
